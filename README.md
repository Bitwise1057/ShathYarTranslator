# Shath'yar Translation / Encoding Addon 
# (WIP - Not Ready For Deployment.)

A lightweight but verbose RP addon for Shath'yar translation and encoding, written in Lua for World of Warcraft.

While this addon is designed to "translate" your messages into Shath'yar, it will not translate the existing language in the game nor will it translate what is said by other language addons.

## Usage

This addon provides multiple slash commands to facilitate Shath'yar roleplay communication. All slash commands work similarly and are straightforward to use.

If targeting a player then your translated speech will be whispered to your target for translation.

### Available Slash Commands

- `/shsay` — Sends a Shath'yar encoded message in /say chat  
- `/shyell` — Sends a Shath'yar encoded message in /yell chat  
- `/shparty` — Sends a Shath'yar encoded message to your party  
- `/shraid` — Sends a Shath'yar encoded message to your raid  
- `/shemote` — Sends a Shath'yar encoded emote

### Example
